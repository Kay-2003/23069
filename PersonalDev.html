        <p>Mack's Diner is exactly the kind of place you'd expect a maintenance guy to hang out in. Michael and Charlie met up four weeks ago, so Michael called Charlie to meet at the Diner. Charlie had some errands to run in the same vicinity of the Diner, so he came up with that as their first trip. Being old-timers, Michael walks slowly, but Charlie assured him that it's normal for older folks to take their time.</p>
        <br>
        <p>They sat down at a table, and their waitress came to take their orders. Charlie informed Michael that her name was Sue. They began discussing Charlie's work at Twelve Pillars, to which Michael replied that he had been there since the first day it was being built. They started talking about flowers and Michael's relationship with Amy.</p>

        <p>Charlie replied, "Just remember that once a flower blooms, it still needs water and sun to keep it from wilting. The work isn't over when the color comes out."</p>

        <p>Charlie asked Michael about his career goals, and suggested that having no goals might be why he wasn’t achieving what he wanted. Mr. Davis, a favorite subject of Charlie’s, teaches about goal-setting and its power in bringing goals into reality. Writing down 100 goals is a great start, as it brings awareness and gets the mind working toward them. Michael agreed to write down his goals, realizing that it could help him become a better person.</p>
        <br>
        <p>Michael emphasized the importance of setting long-range goals and working backward to achieve them. For example, if you want to achieve a certain life, income, or job in ten years, start with a long-range goal, then set a mid-range goal for five years, and finally a short-range goal for one or two years. By setting a goal and working backward, Michael encourages others to chart their own paths and reach their goals.</p>
        <br>
        <p>Michael and Charlie discussed the importance of spending their days wisely. Michael, overwhelmed with work, home, wife, and kids, struggled to find a goal. Charlie explained that the pain of discipline weighs ounces, but the pain of regret weighs tons. Michael was reminded that without achieving his goals, he would have deep regrets later in life.</p>
        <br>
        <p>Davis, Charlie, and Michael also discussed time management, stressing the importance of managing time instead of letting the urgent things rule our lives. Taking cues from Davis, Michael agreed to manage his schedule better. Charlie appreciated Michael’s efforts, emphasizing how crucial it is to have control over time to live a balanced life.</p>
        <br>
        <p>Three weeks later, Michael returned to Twelve Pillars to share his progress with Charlie. They discussed the importance of surrounding oneself with successful people who share similar values. Mr. Davis taught that the people you associate with will have a profound effect on your life. Charlie’s lifelong friends, John, Clark, and Tom, have supported each other since third grade, and their discussions have influenced their lives.</p>
        <br>
        <p>Charlie emphasized that successful people build relationships with others who challenge and encourage them to grow. Michael cited Mr. Davis’s advice that to attract powerful, committed people, one must first work on themselves.</p>
        <br>
        <p>Michael is focusing on personal development and building relationships with successful people. He believes that showing ambition and investing in others' success can lead to fulfilling relationships and a better life.</p>
        <br>
        <p>Charlie emphasized the idea that self-education is crucial to success. Most people don’t continue learning, but those who do are well on their way to improving their lives. Michael, initially uncertain, realized that even his conversations with Charlie were a form of self-education.</p>
        <br>
        <p>Michael questioned the importance of books, to which Charlie responded that books are one of the best learning resources available. The cost of not reading a book far outweighs the price of the book itself. Michael eventually agreed to read "The Magic of Thinking Big," which Charlie offered him, and left feeling inspired to think bigger and learn more.</p>
        <br>
        <h1>Conclusion</h1>
        <br>
        <p>I've learned from Twelve Pillars that personal development is a continuous process that calls for commitment, goal-setting.The story provided an insightful reminder that success involves more than just reaching goals on the outside; it also entails improving oneself in the process. It is important  to set  goals and work forward to attain them.  I'm motivated to set objectives for myself and go into each day with more purpose.</p>
